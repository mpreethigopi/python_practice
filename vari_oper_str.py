#1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.

"""a=15
b=30
c=(a+b)/2
print("The sum of (15+30)/2 is: ", c)"""


#2.  Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.

"""a=int(input("Enter the value for a: "))
b=int(input("Enter the value for b: "))
add=a+b
print("The sum of a and b is:", add)

sub=a-b
print("The subtraction of a and b is:", sub)

mul=a*b
print("The multiplication of a and b is:", mul)

div=a/b
print("The division of a and b is:", div)

reminder=a%b
print("The reminder of a and b is:", reminder)"""

#3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.

name="Preethi"

#4. Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item.

a,b,c=("Pasta","Pizza","Idly")
print(a)

#5. Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.
a="Hello "
c=a*10
print(c)
print("Hello "*5)

#6. Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment
name,age=("Preethi", 34)
print(age)

#7. Create two strings and then create a third variable combining both of the two original strings.
a="fname"
b="lname"
c=a+b
print(c)

#8. Create a string and print the fourth letter of the word.
a="fnamelname"
print(a[3])

#9. Create a string and print the letters from index 0 to 5.
print(a[0:5])

#10. Create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end.
print(a[1: ])

sen1 = "Pizza is love. Pizza is life."
print(sen1[1:])
